# networkframework

A lightweight Swift networking framework providing a unified API for making HTTP requests using Combine, async/await, or completion handlers.

## Features
- Combine publisher-based requests
- Async/await requests
- Completion handler requests
- Unified error handling with `APIServiceError`

## Usage

### Combine Example
```swift
let service = NetworkService()
service.sendRequest(endpoint: myEndpoint, type: MyModel.self)
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        // handle error or finished
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        // handle value
    })
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### Async/Await Example
```swift
let service = NetworkService()
do {
    let result: MyModel = try await service.sendRequest(endpoint: myEndpoint)
    // handle result
} catch {
    // handle error
}
```

### Completion Handler Example
```swift
let service = NetworkService()
service.sendRequest(endpoint: myEndpoint) { (result: Result<MyModel, APIServiceError>) in
    switch result {
    case .success(let value):
        // handle value
    case .failure(let error):
        // handle error
    }
}
```

## Documentation
